#Alert
This is a project for Bitcamp(https://bitca.mp/) and I created a web app named Alert that facilitates communication during times of emergency. Alert allows gesture recognitions on the mobile screen to execute certain actions. For instance, through drawing a square on the mobile screen, the user will be able to automatically send emergency text messages and even make phone calls to others. Also, Alert incorporates geo-location and can create contact with nearby government facilities. 

Thus, Alert greatly decreases the ease with which individuals communicate at times of emergency, such as robbery and sexual assault, and helps create a support system among close friends. In addition, Alert has the potential to facilitate communications beyond the time of emergencies. For instance, it may allow young children to seamlessly communicate with their parents through gestures without typing.
